The Mating Ritual Problem
==========================
The procedure for finding a stable matching involves a Mating Ritual that takes place over several days. The following events happen each day:

**Morning**: Each woman stands on her balcony. Each man stands under the balcony of his favorite among the women on his list, and he serenades her. If a man has no women left on his list, he stays home and does his math homework.

**Afternoon**: Each woman who has one or more suitors serenading her, says to her favorite among them, "We might get engaged. Come back tomorrow." To the other suitors, she says, "No, I will never marry you! Take a hike!"

**Evening**: Any man who is told by a woman to take a hike, crosses that woman off his list.

**Termination condition**: When a day arrives in which every woman has at most one suitor, the ritual ends with each woman marrying her suitor if she has one.
