A Repository for my MIT Challenge
=====================================
This repository contains any codes from MIT courses I took, such as the codes from the problem sets and etc.

MIT Challenge is just a personal challenge! Its goal is to complete the core subjects in 4 years of Computer Science Degree at MIT ASAP(which is.. less than 6 months). I have constructed my own curriculum, which I will post on my blog sooner or later. Courses are chosen based on the actual curriculum and the availability of the course at OCW or MOOC. I excluded elective courses just to concentrate on Computer Science.
